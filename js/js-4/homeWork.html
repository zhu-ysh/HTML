        The word “horse-power” was first used two hundred years ago. James Watt from<br/>
    a worker‟s family made the world first widely used steam engine. At first, he couldn‟t<br/>
    tell people how powerful it was, because there were no units at that time. Watt decided<br/>
    to find out how much work one strong horse could do in one minute. He named that<br/>
    unit one horse-power. In this way he could measure the work of his steam engine.
